- **URL**: https://github.com/myriadrf/LoRa-SDR
- **License**: GPL-3.0
- **Author**: MyriadRF
- **Purpose**: Reference implementation for validation

## Usage
The original LoRa-SDR submodule is used for:
- Generating golden test vectors
- Validating bit-exact compatibility
- Reference implementation comparison

## Credits
- **MyriadRF**: Original LoRa-SDR implementation
- **Semtech**: LoRa technology and specifications
- **KISS-FFT**: FFT library (included in original)

## License Notice
This lightweight implementation is derived from the original LoRa-SDR
but is designed to be standalone with minimal dependencies.
